# Contributing to LoRaLib

First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to contribute! All feedback and ideas are greatly appreciated.
To keep this library organized, please follow these rules.

1. **Questions are welcome, spam is not.**  
Any issues without description will be considered spam and as such will be **CLOSED** and **LOCKED** immediately!
2. **This repository has issue templates.**  
To report bugs or suggest new features, use the provided issue templates. Use the default issue only if the templates do not fit your issue type.
3. **LoRaLib is a driver.**  
This means that only features available in the SX127x chips will be implemented. LoRaLib will not implement protocols such as LoRaWAN.
