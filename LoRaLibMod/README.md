# LoRaLib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jgromes/LoRaLib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jgromes/LoRaLib)

## Arduino library for LoRa modules based on SX1278 and SX1272 chips

## See the [Wiki](https://github.com/jgromes/LoRaLib/wiki) for detailed API reference and further information.

### This is not the shield you are looking for!
If you're looking for an open-source shield to use with this library, it has its own repository: [https://github.com/jgromes/LoRenz](https://github.com/jgromes/LoRenz)

This library enables easy long range communaction with SX127x family of LoRa modules. It was designed to be used with LoRenz Rev.B shields. However, they are not required and this library can be used with any LoRa module, as long as it is based on of the Semtech LoRa chips.

Currently supported chips:
* SX1272 and SX1273
* SX1278, SX1276, SX1277 and SX1279

Currently supported platforms:
* All Arduino AVR boards (tested on Uno and Mega)
* ESP32
* ESP8266 NodeMCU
